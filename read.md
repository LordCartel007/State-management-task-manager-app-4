To-Do App with React
This is a simple To-Do App built using React that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The tasks are saved in the local storage of the browser, so they persist even when the page is refreshed.

Features
Add tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
Edit tasks: Users can edit existing tasks.
Delete tasks: Users can delete tasks from the list.
Persist tasks: Tasks are saved to local storage, ensuring they persist across page reloads.
Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
Local Storage: To save tasks in the browser's local storage.
CSS: For styling the app.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd todo-app
Install the required dependencies:

bash

npm install
Run the app locally:

bash
npm start
This will start the development server, and you can view the app at http://localhost:3000.

How It Works

1. Adding Tasks
   Users can add a task by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
   The new task will be displayed in the list and saved to local storage.
2. Editing Tasks
   Each task has an "Edit" button.
   When clicked, the task becomes editable, allowing users to change the task text.
   After editing, the task will be saved again in local storage.
3. Deleting Tasks
   Each task also has a "Delete" button.
   Clicking the "Delete" button will remove the task from the list and update local storage.
4. Persisting Data
   Tasks are stored in the local storage of the browser. When the app is refreshed, tasks will still appear as they were left.
